  "HandPedalDispatchActor — the ISCO-08 9331 hand and pedal vehicle
  dispatch coordination actor as a `langgraph.graph/state-graph`
  (ADR-2607121000 / CLAUDE.md Actors section). One graph run = one
  dispatch/logistics coordination operation request (intake → advise →
  govern → decide → commit/hold, with a human-approval interrupt for
  escalated proposals). No infinite internal loop; checkpointed per
  superstep so an interrupted run can resume after human sign-off.
  Modeled on cloud-itonami-isco-3313's accountingsupport.actor.

  :intake -> :advise -> :govern -> :decide -+-> :commit            (:ok? true)
                                             +-> :request-approval   (:escalate? true, interrupt-before)

  ```

  The unconditional invariant: the Hand/Pedal Vehicle Dispatch Advisor
  can never directly commit a record the HandPedalDispatchGovernor
  refuses — every commit-record! call is gated behind `:decide`. This
  actor coordinates DISPATCH/LOGISTICS SCHEDULING ONLY: it never
  operates a rickshaw/pedicab/hand-cart, and it never finalizes a
  route/traffic-navigation decision or overrides the driver's on-road
  safety judgment — that authority never leaves the human driver."
